# ToDo Kanban Board

Welcome to ToDo Kanban Board! This project allows you to manage your tasks using a Kanban board, where you can organize your tasks into different lists such as To-Do, Doing, and Done. Additionally, you can customize lists, edit tasks, remove tasks, and transfer tasks between lists.

## Features

## Task Status Indicators

- **Missed:** If the task is already due, it will be marked as "missed."
- **Urgent:** If the task is due in 3 days or less, it will be marked as "urgent."
